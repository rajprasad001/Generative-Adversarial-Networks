# Generative-Adversarial-Networks

[GANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) are special Deep Neural Networks to generate/mimic results very much similar to the actual data. The model comprises two different networks namely a Generator and a Discriminator. Both the networks compete against each other thus called adversarial.

GANs are mainly used in 
* Image-to-Image Translation
* 3D Object Generation
* Super Resolution

A cool application of GANs can be seen on a website [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/). The images appearing do look 100% real but are result of GANs.
